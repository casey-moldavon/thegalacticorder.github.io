                            <p>The Title of Acting Officer is slightly different from the usual Rank 3 Officer positions. Typically, an individual becomes an Officer through the standard means of rank progression, based on activity and determination that is expressed through their achievements recorded in The Galactic Order Roster. However, in times of need, when there are limited members of authority to accommodate a large gap in the ranks, experienced individuals will receive the Leadership Commendation by a Captain or Admiral, with the available option to hold the temporary title of Acting Officer. This is a premature promotion to Rank 3, often offered to Rank 2 units of that Division who have shared interest in the advancements of The Galactic Order along with ambition for holding greater authority & responsibility.</p>
                            <p>Acting Officers receive all benefits and advantages of the rank they are given. For all intended purposes, they are Rank 3 in their Division. However, this role comes with some limitations that should be noted…</p>

For this reason, it is recommended that Acting Officers make their best efforts to earn the position they’ve been given, removing the “Acting” title and granting official permanence in the Role.</li>
