            <p><a id="leadership_division">Introduction:</a></p>
            <p>More commonly found aboard larger ships and vessels, Captains are held to the highest of standards, with nearly complete authority and command over their own personal battalion which may consist of multiple ships, up to 25 crew and specific roles, all of which the captain claims full responsibility. In the absence of an Admiral, the captain’s word is law first and foremost followed by their appointed 1st officer, typically promoted from the position of Commander, acting outside any division. This information can all vary depending on the battalion type and its size along with any limits declared by the assigned fleet Admiralty.</p>
            <p>The Rank of Captain is awarded in 1 of two situations. Either a Captain is promoted to assume command of an existing Battalion or they are appointed to form their own. Both are considered a great honor and hold unique challenges.</p>

            <p id="small_space"></p>

            <p><a id="bold_note">Note:</a> Captain limit per Battalion:  <a id="leadership_division_text">1</a></p>

            <p id="break_space"></p>

            <p><a id="leadership_division">New Battalion:</a></p>
            <p>The promotion to Captain with the option to form one’s own battalion comes with the challenge of deciding what battalion type that captain will adopt as it will often be a choice they can make for themselves. Only in the situation where Admiralty holds specific needs for a fleet is there an exception to this. Captains in a New Battalion position will also have their choice of ship(s) and crew. Because promotion to Captain in this context requires that they must achieve the rank of Commander in at least 2 different Divisions, it is typically recommended that they form their battalion based on a past-served division (not required).</p>

            <p id="break_space"></p>

            <p><a id="leadership_division">Assume Battalions:</a></p>
            <p>The promotion to Captain in this context can have very different settings and outcomes. In most cases, the promotion to Captain for an existing battalion (whether it be a promotion from within or outside the battalion itself) is to fill the gap left by the previous captain who was removed from their role by either demotion or permanent death. In most cases, the acting 1st Officer will take the role of captain, though this can occasionally be a temporary promotion if they do not hold the necessary prerequisites or experience for such a role. In the event of a Captain’s permanent death or demotion where no replacement can be found, the battalion is typically dissolved and its members absorbed into other battalions.</p>
            <p>Within both methods of promotion, the captain holds the same level of authority with regards to the crew, ship(s) and even the battalion type itself which they may change upon the approval of their assigned fleet admiralty.</p>

            <p id="break_space"></p>

            <p><a id="leadership_division">Battalion Funding:</a></p>
            <p>Captains will receive a set amount of funds granted by their fleet admiralty. These funds are standard throughout the Galactic Order and are based primarily on the average costs per Battalion type (Example: Combat, Industrial, etc..). They do not take into account the ship type, number of ships or the number of assigned crew as these choices are made by the captain. Funds are transferred to the Acting Captain of a Battalion on the 1st of each month whom then distributes the funds to their battalion members at the time of their choosing (Standard: bi-weekly).</p>
            <p>These funds are meant to account for the payment of crew, supplies, fuel, armaments, maintenance and the average expenditures. However, despite Admiralty holding final say, it is typically the captain who chooses how the funds are distributed and used. This responsibility can, of course, be delegated by the captain (usually to the 1st Officer) but most tend to establish a framework before doing so.</p>
            <p>It is worth noting that, although the Galactic Order has an established standard for Unit Allowance with regards to benefits, Captains may ultimately choose how much more or less their battalion members are paid. As Unit Allowances make up the majority of battalion funds, the decision of pay usually focuses on the necessary crew for either optimal or minimal battalion functionality. With larger ships requiring greater crew sizes, individual pay will often range on the lower end unless the acting Captain acquires funds independently from legal outside sources. This is exceedingly common as Galactic Order members have full access to unit allowance information for all battalions, not just their own. Knowing this, it goes without saying that members will be fully aware if they are making significantly less income than members of the same rank in other battalions which can lead to animosity and conflict.</p>
            <p>However, the opposite can also be said to occur, where a captains may find themselves with additional funds remaining as a result of operating a minimum crew below the estimated battalion average. Some ships are even designed for this purpose, leaving the captain in an advantageous position to put the additional funds towards further efforts of efficiency to better the fleet and Galactic Order as a whole. Sadly, Captains have been found to abuse this system of funding on occasion by providing crew with less pay and keeping the difference for themselves in addition to personal allowances (which are not always guaranteed as this is included among battalion funds as a whole). Abuse of the system in this way is notably the leading cause for demotion among Captains following an investigation by either the Admiralty or an appointed 3rd party.</p>
            <p>The role of Captain within the Galactic Order is a very challenging one but comes with great authority and reward to match its ever-present levels of responsibility. Rank 4 is considered part of the Leadership division which opens many doors within the Galactic Order. More specifically, this rank grants access to organization meetings of high clearance which are known to play an important part in the overall vision and planning for the Galactic Order’s future.</p>
