                        <p>These exist within only but a few divisions as alternate promotion branches available to some units as a possible variant to the standard path of progression. These are often slightly easier to achieve in terms of prerequisites to what would normally be expected from a role of the same rank but also hold a number of disadvantages such as hindering rank progression beyond the sub-division role or being excluded from the standard chain of command giving less authority within the Galactic Order. It is worth noting that sub-divisions occasionally act as a hybrid, incorporating privileges and responsibilities from other division roles as well as prerequisites. In many cases, these specialized roles will be made available to those whom have served in multiple divisions.</p>

                        <p><a id="combat_division_text">Units:</a> Most battalions utilize units from multiple divisions to function at or above 75% capability, requiring 5 or more crew members minimum to operate (not factoring in different shifts). The standard battalion size is anywhere between 10 to 25 units when taking shifts and leadership into consideration. More than 25 units will classify the battalion as Large, a title reserved typically for special battalion types such as Admiralty or Academy.</p>

                        <p>Statistically speaking, if all regulations and minimum requirements are met, there is technically no max number of ships that may be present within a single battalion, the exception being what the Battalion Captain is capable / comfortable handling and limits set by Admiralty.</p>

                        <p>There are several Battalion Types, each organized to perform specific tasks and hold focused responsibilities based on the chosen primary Ship. Battalions have their own unique blend of units from each division, assigned to accommodate the necessary roles required for optimal efficiency. Listed below are the battalion types currently implemented within The Galactic Order...</p>

                        <p id="break_space"></p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><a id="leadership_division_text">Admiralty:</a> Led by an Admiral, this Battalion’s Primary Ship is considered the “Flag Ship”, acting as the hub for all decisions within the Fleet. The most common Primary Ships for this type are multi-purpose.</li>

                            <p id="break_space"></p>

                            <li><a id="academy_battalion">Academy:</a> This type has the expressed and specific purpose of research, development, education, and unit training. The majority of The Galactic Order’s overall progression occurs in these battalions as they are often the starting point for nearly all Novitiates first entering the Organization. As Academy Battalions lead into all other Battalion types, units from every Division can be found here. Similar to Admiralty, these often utilize a multi-purpose Primary Ship along with many support ships and fighters, giving the nickname:  “Mini-Fleets”.</li>

                            <p id="break_space"></p>

                            <li><a id="combat_division_text">Battle:</a> Although combat units are in every battalion, this type is often centered around protection, preservation of peace and establishing law & order with militant force. The most common Primary Ships for this type are Carriers, Gun Ships, Frigates & Corvettes.</li>

                            <p id="break_space"></p>

                            <li><a id="engineer_division_text">Industrial:</a> This Battalion is mostly comprised of engineering division units and holds the largest array of career positions and responsibilities. The most common Primary Ships for this type are heavy: Salvage, Mining, Transport/Touring, Freight, Repair, Refueling & Construction.</li>

                            <p id="break_space"></p>

                            <li><a id="medical_division_text">Medivac:</a> This Battalion mostly consists of medical division units and has a primary focus on Search and Rescue. The most common Primary Ship for this type is the Endeavor with Hospital Attachments.</li>

                            <li><a id="science_division_text">Exploration:</a> This battalion mostly consists of science division units and leads in discovery, colonization and scientific progression. The most common Primary Ships for this type are Expedition, Touring & Science.</li>

                        <p>Battalions are named with a designation number (F-##) to indicate the assigned Fleet/Admiral followed by the Captain’s Last name, the first Letter of their battalion Type (B for Battle, E for Exploration, etc…) and a number starting at ‘01’. This number is significant for fleets with multiple Battalions of the same type.</p>
