        <p id="inner_text" >The Galactic Order was initially Founded in the year 2951 by Gerard “Holland” Augustinus and Cosmo “Captain” Remington. Both 
            had suffered the scars of war brought on by the Vanduul forces that threatened humanity through-out the vers, and both had 
            seen the incompetence and ineptitude of the UEE, among other Organizations, to properly handle the threat. The would-be Admirals 
            hailed from very different backgrounds which aided in their abilities to contribute to their new order in very unique ways…</p>

        <p>Cosmo “Captain” Remington hailed from a life of combat and military-style living. His call-sign CR 4-ZY was more commonly referenced 
            than his actual name. He organized the troops by forming the initial battalion roles, ranks, responsibilities, policies and overall 
            structure of The Galactic Order military forces.</p>

        <p>Gerard “Holland” Augustinus hailed from a life of higher society, education, status and political awareness. He established The 
            Galactic Order’s dealings, trade routes, general economy, negotiations and political standings. He would also act as the first 
            voice of authority within the organization, laying down the Hammer when it was needed.</p>

        <p>Within the first year of the Order’s formation, the two founders quickly understood that humanity itself would need greater steps 
            to progress forward and survive the threats they faced in light of other advanced species and alien races. From this realization, 
            the idea of furthering human evolution was born, which formed the organization’s science division. Utilizing technologies outside 
            those of humanity alone, this division became another unique cornerstone of The Galactic Order’s foundation as they would be willing to 
            push humanity forward by any means necessary, something other major organizations foolishly feared.</p>

        <p>In addition to a broad spectrum of ships, weapons and armor of various racial origins, biological engineering and cybernetic implants 
            would be developed to improve the future super soldiers of the Galactic Order. Greater plans were even drawn to grow genetically 
            improved embryos once the order was further established. With these enhancements, a strict code of honor, expert training 
            and highly advanced technologies... these new super soldiers would usher in a new age of peace and stability throughout the galaxy 
            to ensure humanity’s survival. The white and black armor of The Galactic Order would be seen and recognized by all as a symbol 
            of strength, evolution and unification.</p>
