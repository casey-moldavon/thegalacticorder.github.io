        <p id="inner_text" >The Galactic Order was initially Founded in the year 2951 by Gerard “Holland” Augustinus and Cosmo “Captain” Remington. Both 
            had suffered the scars of war brought on by the Vanduul forces that threatened humanity through-out the vers, and both had 
            seen the incompetence and ineptitude of the UEE, among other Organizations, to properly handle the threat. The would-be Admirals 
            hailed from very different backgrounds which aided in their abilities to contribute to their new order in very unique ways…</p>

        <img id="smaller_image1" src="../assets/images/join_today.jpeg" alt="Join Today Image">

        <p>Cosmo “Captain” Remington hailed from a life of combat and military-style living. His call-sign CR 4-ZY was more commonly referenced 
            than his actual name. He organized the troops by forming the initial battalion roles, ranks, responsibilities, policies and overall 
            structure of The Galactic Order military forces.</p>

        <p>Gerard “Holland” Augustinus hailed from a life of higher society, education, status and political awareness. He established The 
            Galactic Order’s dealings, trade routes, general economy, negotiations and political standings. He would also act as the first 
            voice of authority within the organization, laying down the Hammer when it was needed.</p>

        <p>Within the first year of the Order’s formation, the two founders quickly understood that humanity itself would need greater steps 
            to progress forward and survive the threats they faced in light of other advanced species and alien races. From this realization, 
            the idea of furthering human evolution was born, which formed the organization’s science division. Utilizing technologies outside 
            those of humanity alone, this division became another unique cornerstone of The Galactic Order’s foundation as they would be willing to 
            push humanity forward by any means necessary, something other major organizations foolishly feared.</p>

        <p>In addition to a broad spectrum of ships, weapons and armor of various racial origins, biological engineering and cybernetic implants 
            would be developed to improve the future super soldiers of the Galactic Order. Greater plans were even drawn to grow genetically 
            improved embryos once the order was further established. With these enhancements, a strict code of honor, expert training 
            and highly advanced technologies... these new super soldiers would usher in a new age of peace and stability throughout the galaxy 
            to ensure humanity’s survival. The white and black armor of The Galactic Order would be seen and recognized by all as a symbol 
            of strength, evolution and unification.</p>

        <p>While traveling with his family through a thick asteroid belt on their 890 Jump, Gerard “Holland” Augustinus and his family were attacked by some Vanduul fighters. As the ship began to shake and the sounds of explosion filled the halls, Gerard knew things were taking a turn for the worst. He ran to the cockpit to see what the situation was, but found one of his pilots dead already from a terminal that exploded nearby. The other man was severally injured and could barely keep his eyes open. Gerard tried to take matters into his own hands and began a call for help. But there was no response to his pleas, and he could only imagine the worst to come. More explosions echoed throughout the ship, and he started running back to where his family was on the other side of the ship.</p>

        <p>When he got to the door and tried to activate the opening mechanism it was jammed, the ship had already been too badly damaged, and he could see his family on the other side of the door. He tried to call out to them with muffled sounds, as his wife looked up at him, the window was blown asunder. With the decompression of the room, Gerard’ family was torn into the vacuum of space. Tears welled up in Gerards eyes as he watched his family die, the sound of sirens and explosions was the last thing he heard before all went black.</p>

        <p>When he finally awoke, he saw a white ceiling with iridescent lamps. There was pain all over his body and was barely able to move. A doctor came in to tell him of the terrible news, and how they came to find him drifting in space. She held a data slate in front of him explaining the extensive procedures they had to put him through to save his life, replacing both of his legs and left arm with alloy prosthetics. His left eye had also been replaced; it was why it was still covered by a bandage. After the doctor left, Gerard sat in disbelief and the utter feeling of defeat. It was at this moment that he felt betrayed by the people who had sworn to protect citizens like him. “The UEE...” he thought as he scoffed at the name, disgusted by their failure to save his family from such a barbaric race.</p>

        <p>When he regained his health, he set in motion a plan to end the horror that would be bestowed on humanity by the alien scum known as the Vanduul. His aim is to bring together mankind under one banner, so that they may fight back against the Vanduul, and bring humanity to even greater technological heights.</p>

        <a id="leadership_division_text">Personal Bio:</a>

        <P>Cosmo Remington was found and adopted at the very young age of 5, taken in by the captain of a renowned mercenary ship working under a private contract for the UEE Military. The captain (name unknown) stumbled upon Cosmo during a pirate raid on a space station where the child had been orphaned/abandoned, possibly by one of the pirates residing there. The captain’s crew, which were each assigned designations based on the initials of the ship’s name (Cosmic Raider), began addressing the child as CR 4-Z, a variant call sign of the recently departed crew member CR 4-Y whom had lost their life during the raid, the joke being that the child had become his replacement.</P>

        <P>The CR referred to the ship’s name: Cosmic Raider and the number referred to the position designation of that crew member on the ship itself. Number 4 was responsible for turret operation, assisting in ship maintenance and ground assault/infiltration on various missions. The letter following the number had progressed from A to B and B to C whenever the position was… re-filled. The call-sign became the child’s name as he did not previously have one, eventually evolving into CR4ZY which everyone simply pronounced as “Crazy”. The ship quickly became his home, the crew his family and the job his life.</P>

        <P>As time went on, Cr4zy found himself traveling to all parts of the known vers, meeting different people and learning different cultures. The work was hard and the life was even harder, often spent in some of the worst parts the galaxy had to offer. At first it was exciting, endearing even. But with the endless battles, crimes and war, the life of a Bounty Hunter grew tiresome. The final straw came in the year 2941.</P>

        <P>The Cosmic Raider had taken on a contract with the UEE Military to provide protective support for a recovery vessel sent to investigate a space station that had suddenly gone silent. The contract stipulated that the Mercenary ship would act as secondary support only since the UEE Fleet was also expected to secure the station moments before the recovery ship’s scheduled arrival. Sadly, upon exiting quantum, this simple mission was found to be anything but. The fleet had been completely decimated in moments from hundreds of Vanduul ships that had been hiding in the station’s remains to initiate an ambush. The UEE, unprepared and unaware, had fallen for the trap and failed to react in time despite outnumbering the Vanduul forces in ships, resources and firepower 3 to 1.</P>

        <P>The battle was the hardest the Cosmic Raider had ever faced, ending with the ship nearly destroyed along with heavy casualties including the ship’s captain (Cr4zy’s adoptive father). The station was completely gone, all of its civilian occupants dead along with the UEE Fleet that was sent to secure it. The wreckage was a sight none could ever forget. But Crazy saw not just the damage the Vanduul could cause but also the utter failings of the UEE Military to stop them. With a heavy heart fueled by grief and purpose, Cr4zy assumed the position as Captain of the Cosmic Raider and took on the name Cosmo Remington (origin unknown) to mark the beginning of his new life. From there, he set off in search of a way to build a better galaxy, eventually co-founding the Galactic Order to unite all life under one banner ensuring safety and security throughout the known universe. Today he holds the name still but close friends, crew and most colleagues refer to him as Captain Cr4zy, a name he holds dear to his heart, grounding him in his purpose and helping him to never forget the past.</P>

        <p>At this moment, The Galactic Order strives to expand in numbers, resources and experience. Our primary goal will be realized once we can explore further into the Galaxy, locate a system to claim as our own and only continue to grow from there.
